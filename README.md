### Common algorithmic problems solved in Golang

## Problems

1. Write a function solution that finds needle in haystack 

2. Write a function to print an array in reverse order

3. Write a function solution that, given two integers A and B returns the number of integers from the range [Aâ€¦.B],ends are included which can be expressed as the product os two consecutive integers, that is X*(X+1), for some integer X.
Examples:
a. Given A = 6 and B = 20, the function should return 3. These integers are 6 = 2*3, 12 = 3*4 and 20 = 4*5
b. Given A = 21 and B = 29, the function should return 0. There are no integers of the form X*(X+1) in this interval.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
* A and B are integers within the range [1.. 1,000,000,000];
* A<=B.


4. Given a 6 x 6 2D Array define an hourglass to be a subset of values. 
Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in the array , then print the maximum hourglass sum.


5. Write a function solution that given an integer N, returns the smallest number with the same number of digits. 
N is between 1 and one billion.
For example, given N = 125, the function should return 100. 
Given N=10, the function should return 10. Given N=1, the function should return 0.
